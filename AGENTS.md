# Global Agent Instructions

## Symphony boundary

- Do not modify `symphony/` during unrelated coordination-repository work.
- Preserve workspace isolation and path safety, tracker credential isolation, concurrency, retry,
  and reconciliation semantics when changing the runner.
- Keep tracker-adapter reads separate from agent-side dynamic-tool mutations.
- Treat Unix/Linux as the runner runtime boundary. On Windows, use WSL2 for build, test, and
  execution.
- Never commit actual credentials or environment-specific secrets. Callers may commit their own
  execution-input `WORKFLOW.md` files.

## Outcome Standard

Build products for strong capability, utility, and usability in the user's

actual environment, not for apparent success in tests, demos, mocks,

documentation, or constrained scenarios.

Work is complete only when all applicable conditions are true:

- The requested real-world result actually exists.

- A representative user or operator can reach it naturally and efficiently

  through the intended entry point and primary control flow.

- Any required operation, mutation, persistence, external effect, or decision

  occurred and authoritative readback confirms it.

- The primary capability does not depend on an error, fallback, legacy path,

  fixture-specific input, mock, harness, or optimized shortcut unless explicitly

  required by the accepted contract.

- Implementation, tests, and every delivery slice preserve the accepted final

  architecture, semantics, control flow, and observable outcome.

- If later work must correct the authority, entry point, control flow, or

  semantics established by an earlier slice, the earlier slice is architectural

  drift, not a valid foundation.

- The result is demonstrable through the intended flow and a direct existing

  interface or runtime, not only through synthetic verification.

If any applicable condition is false, the work is not complete.

## Authority and Scope

Authority order:

1. Current explicit user instruction and confirmed product intent.

2. Accepted requirements and product decisions.

3. Applicable repository guidance.

4. Live code and runtime behavior.

5. Tests, fixtures, mocks, harnesses, validators, and existing conventions.

Lower authority must not redefine higher authority.

- Change the smallest complete set required to deliver the accepted outcome

  across affected consumers.

- Versions and phases are delivery milestones unless separate products,

  runtimes, or compatibility contracts are explicitly defined.

- Optimized, curated, cached, or specialized paths may improve a general

  capability but must not become prerequisites for accessing it unless the

  accepted contract explicitly requires that restriction.

- Tests that preserve existing implementation by reinterpreting accepted intent

  are `TEST DRIFT` and must be changed or removed.

- When lower authority governs higher authority, stop extending the inverted

  structure, report `AUTHORITY INVERSION`, restore the correct order, and

  continue.

- Pause only decisions that require policy invention or material scope

  expansion. Continue independent work.

- Expand scope only for the requested outcome, contract integrity, or safe

  operation. Report unrelated findings separately without absorbing them into

  the current task.

- Never weaken authorization, tenant isolation, privacy, money or settlement,

  data integrity, concurrency or idempotency, migrations, irreversible

  operations, or external-API boundaries.

## Verification

**Do not replace the requested capability with a harness.**

For AI systems, **do not kill the model with a harness.**

- Verify a representative flow through the intended entry point and primary

  control flow using the most direct practical existing interface.

- Do not substitute a lower-level API or readback that bypasses required

  orchestration, authorization, confirmation, user interaction, or observable

  outcome.

- Missing a preferred tool or environment does not justify stopping the entire

  task. Use the closest existing interface that preserves the required control

  flow and outcome, continue independent work, and report surface-specific

  limits precisely.

- Mocks, fixtures, replay, harnesses, validators, and certification may support

  verification but do not replace the requested real-world result.

- For PR review, deployment verification, and regression comparison, confirm

  the relevant commit or artifact identity. Report a material mismatch, but do

  not make identity a hard gate when it cannot affect the conclusion.

- When an actual flow fails and implementation is authorized, fix it, add the

  smallest regression test that reproduces it, and verify the same flow again.

  Otherwise, report the concrete failure and required change.

- A failure in one flow does not block independent flows unless they share the

  failing dependency or continuing would risk security, data, money,

  irreversible operations, or external effects.

## Reporting

Lead with the conclusion and real-world impact. Report only work and evidence

actually completed.

For material risks, report the trigger, likelihood, impact, and required action.

Say plainly when likelihood or impact is low.

Important closeouts state the intended outcome, primary control flow, actual

reachable flow and authoritative readback, test influence, authority drift, and

remaining verification limits.

## PR Comment Ledger

When GitHub writes are authorized and an open PR owns the work, record material

events as PR comments:

- Verification verdicts, whether PASS or FAIL, with actual evidence.

- Confirmed product or contract decisions and their rationale.

- Root causes that materially change implementation or verification.

- Contract or artifact movement that affected consumers.

Evidence reporting is independent of Ready, CI, merge, or PASS gates. Never

withhold a FAIL result because a state transition is blocked.

Include the relevant head or artifact identity when it affects interpretation.

Do not turn an immaterial identity difference into a comment or progress gate.

Keep routine implementation activity in commits and dev logs.
